## Start-Up Project

This project uses SCSS and TailwindCSS for styling. Follow the steps below to get everything set up.

## Installation

Make sure you're on the `design` branch and located in the **root folder** of the project. Then install the project dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```


## To Run the Scripts
On the `design` branch, you need to run both scripts below to compile the styles properly.

- Compile SCSS

```bash
npm run scss
```

This script compiles the SCSS files into a single CSS file.

---


- Run TailwindCSS

```bash
npm run tailwindcss
```

This script runs the Tailwind CLI to generate utility-based CSS.

You can now add or edit folders and files in the `scss` folder depending on your needs.
